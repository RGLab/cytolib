`cytolib` provides a c++ library for interacting with cytometry data.

-   reading FCS into efficient disk-backed and memory-backed data structures
-   representation of gated cytometry data.
-   core library backing the R packages flowCore, flowWorkspace, CytoML, and others that provide a high level R language interface.

### Reporting Bugs or Issues

-   Use the issue template in github when creating a new issue.
-   Follow the instructions in the template (do your background reading).
-   Search and verify that the issue hasn't already been addressed.
-   Check the Bioconductor support site.
-   Make sure your flow packages are up to date.
-   THEN if your issue persists, file a bug report.

Otherwise, we may close your issue without responding.

## Installation cytolib as a R package

The **cytolib** package can be installed from Github

```
    remotes::install_github("RGLab/cytolib")
```

R packages wishing to use the libraries in `cytolib` need to:

-   add `cytolib` to **LinkingTo** field in the **DESCRIPTION** file so the compiler knows where to find the headers when the user package is complied
    e.g.

```
LinkingTo: cytolib
```

See **CytoML** package for the example of using `cytolib`.

## Installation as a C++ standalone library

**System requirement**

1. cmake
2. g++ (>=4.9) or clang++(>= 7.0.1)
3. libblas, liblapack, ZLIB, boost c++ library
4. protobuf c++ library (>= 3.10)

**Installation**

```bash
# enter your project directory
$ cd cytolib

# it is always a good idea to not pollute the source with build files
# so create a new build directory
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

# run cmake to configure the package for your system
$ cmake ..

# to link against the protobuf that is installed at custom location
# e.g. `cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=</path/to/protobuf>`

# to select different compiler other than the default
# e.g. `cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++`

#To install the library to custom directory, use `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` option
# e.g. `cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local`

$ make

#to install the package
$ make install

```
